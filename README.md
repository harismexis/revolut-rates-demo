### Overview:

The app contains one screen showing a list of currencies and downloads and updates the rates every 1 second. 
Each row has an input where user can enter any amount of money. When user taps on a currency row it slides to
the top and becomes the reference amount for conversion. 
When reference amount changes the app simultaneously updates the corresponding values for other currencies.
