### Overview:

The app has one screen showing a list of currencies and downloads and updates the rates every 1 second. 
The first row has an input where user can enter an amount of money. When user clicks on a row it slides to
the top and becomes the reference amount for conversion. When the reference amount changes the app updates 
the amounts of the other currencies.
